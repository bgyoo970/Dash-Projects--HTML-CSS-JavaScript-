# Dash-Projects--HTML-CSS-JavaScript-
First Projects using HTML CSS and JS

The Personal Website and the Blogging Website mainly explore the use for HTML and CSS while the MadLibs and the Restaurant Website delve more into JavaScript and some use of JQuery.

The Personal Website displays a webpage of a person introducing herself and prompting for an email through a text field and a submit button. This exercise was purely to introduce myself to HTML and a bit of CSS. No JavaScript is linked to the use of sumbitting one's own email.

The Blogging Website displays a person's own personal entries to his experiences similiar to blogging media websites. The purpose of this project was to further explore the use of CSS and make a website more aesthetically pleasing to the users and visitors.

The Restaurant Website displays the website of someone's restaurant with pictures and descriptions of the food presented at her restaurant. This project helped introduce the use of JavaScript and linking functionality behind some of the features of the website. For example, clicking on the name of the dish will reveal the description of the dish. Clicking again will hide it. Further explored the use of CSS and JavaScript.

The Mad Libs project was to learn more of how to implement functionality in webpages. Event listeners, buttons, and input to textfields were utilized to help realize the Mad Libs application. I explored the basic use of JavaScript.
